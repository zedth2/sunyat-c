The SUNYAT is an 8-bit ISA Simulator, originally written by Dr. William “Amos” Confer, with the intention to serve as an educational tool for students learning about Systems Architecture and low-level programming. The system is built in C/C++ and is made up of a Logic Unit and an Assembler.
<br></br>
The Mk II is a fork of the original system, and is the result of what began as a project for one of Dr.Confer’s “special topics” courses on Systems Architecture and Simulation.

The Mk II implements the following new features:<br>
-Additional Registers (36 total)<br>
-Register Windowing<br>
-Auxiliary Calls<br>
-System Savestates<br>
-A Pretty Sweet Debugger<br>
